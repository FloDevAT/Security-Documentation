Already back in ancient times people tried their best to encrypt and obfuscate their messages. Also modern technologies today need those techniques in order to hide information from unauthorized people. This is what this chapter is going to be about: how to let a secret stay a secret.

This chapter will be split into two parts which describe two different approaches of encryption: **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption.

## 📚 Chapters

### 🔐 [Symmentric Encryption](https://github.com/FloDevAT/Security-Documentation/tree/master/layer_6/crypto/symmetric)
*Efficient encryption using a single key for both encryption and decryption*

### 🔐 [Asymmentric Encryption](https://github.com/FloDevAT/Security-Documentation/tree/master/layer_6/crypto/asymmetric)
*Secure communication through key pairs: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption*
