## 📖 Introduction

With the majority of modern applications being web-based, **web exploitation** is one of the most prevalent attack vectors. Weakly secured web applications are highly susceptible to common vulnerabilities. In this chapter, we will explore some of the most frequent threats, including **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**, and more.

## 📚 Chapters

### 🔍 [SQL Injection (SQLi)](https://github.com/FloDevAT/Security-Documentation/tree/master/layer_7/web/sqli)
*Manipulating database queries via user input to gain unauthorized access.*

### 🖥️ [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](https://github.com/FloDevAT/Security-Documentation/tree/master/layer_7/web/ssti)
*Exploiting template engines to execute arbitrary code on the server.*

### ⚠️ [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://github.com/FloDevAT/Security-Documentation/tree/master/layer_7/web/xss)
